1.first of all we want to check the code I have so far and the description txt. Yes a lot of things are implemented already but we need
 to add the remaining attributes, entities and methods. Because some of these things are missing. Also include inheritance, association, etc etc rules of OOP in their relationships
2. Implement the missing parts and add comments everywhere in the code.
3. I need in the main to be able to run a scenario where all entities are utilized. It can be any dummy scenario of your choice
3.create a full class diagram and report which will explain briefly the business scenario and the logic of code
